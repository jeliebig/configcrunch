API Documentation
--------------------

Please note that, since configcrunch is implemented as a native module, the API
documentation here isn't containing any signatures. Please see the `_main.pyi`_ stub file for those.

Additionally you may notice this page being empty on Readthedocs, due to dependency issues.
